The files in this directory comprise the 'Gilman' dataset.  There are
two subdirectories:

    cropped/     - Contains 1,142 cropped images of the backs of cars,
                   organized into 18 sets.  These images were obtained
                   by running the license plate detector on the Gilman
                   video and cropping the middle frame in a tracked
                   sequence.

    frames/      - Contains 1,290 raw frames from the Gilman video at
                   times when the license plate detector fired.

Also included in this directory is an index file -- labels.info -- of
hand coded make and model information for each of the 1,142 images in
the cropped/ subdirectory.
