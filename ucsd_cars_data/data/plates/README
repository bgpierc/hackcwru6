This directory contains video data of the license plate detector's
output for 878 different license plates.  The videos are stored in
the .dat format, which is just a sequence of images taken at 6
frames per second:

  	--myboundary\r
    Content-Type: image/jpeg\r\r
    <JPEG IMAGE DATA>\r
  	--myboundary\r
    Content-Type: image/jpeg\r\r
    <JPEG IMAGE DATA>\r

The license plate number of each sequence is stored in the index
file -- labels.info.
